<p>I grew up in Salt Lake and moved to Central Arkansas in 2022. I spend ample time being an ebike dad, marketing guy, annoying lefty internet guy, and camera guy. This siteâ€™s a portal for most of the things I get up to on the internet.</p>

<p>This site is hosted on Github and uses <a href="https://github.com/jekyll">Jekyll</a>.</p>
