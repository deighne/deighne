## Design / Prints / Merch

Winning the race to have the first good ["Coconut / Context" Kamala 2024 shirt](https://www.redbubble.com/i/t-shirt/Kamala-for-President-2024-Context-Coconut-Tree-Palm-Tree-by-danecd/163124805.WFLAH).

A sampling of my photography and design work are available as prints and items on [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/danecd/shop). If there's something you've seen of mine that you want a print of that isn't on Redbubble, [email me for pricing](mailto:dane@dane.photos).
