I grew up in Salt Lake and moved to Central Arkansas in 2022. I spend ample time being an ebike dad, marketing guy, annoying lefty internet guy, and camera guy. This site's a portal for most of the things I get up to on the internet.

This site is hosted on Github and uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll).
