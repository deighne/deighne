## [Bio](/bio/)
I grew up in Salt Lake and moved to Central Arkansas in 2022. I mostly spend my time biking around, working in marketing, and taking pictures.

## [Photos](/photos/)
I specialize in performance and event photography: musicals, drag, and dance, to name a few, and am also available for promotional photos, headshots and editorial. My portfolio is [over here](/photos/). For rates and availability for an event or session [email me](mailto:deighne@deighne.blog). To see what I've been doing lately, visit my Instagram [@theperfectfruitmadrid](https://www.instagram.com/theperfectfruitmadrid/).

## [Marketing](/marketing/)
I'm currently working as the Digital Marketing lead for [Human Element](https://www.human-element.com/) in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Email me at [ddickerson@human-element.com](mailto:ddickerson@human-element.com) for lead-gen and ecommerce marketing, speaking engagements, and rants about trademark law. I've worked in-house, agency, venture capital, startups, and franchise marketing over the last 10 years; here's my [intermittently updated LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danecd).

## [Design](/design/)
A sampling of my photography and design work are available as prints and items on [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/danecd/shop). If there's something you've seen of mine that you want a print of that isn't on Redbubble, [email me for pricing](mailto:deighne@deighne.blog).
