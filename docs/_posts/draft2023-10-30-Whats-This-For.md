It's 2023 and having your own website is cool again.<!--more--> Or really, it's that using someone else's platform as your website is deeply *uncool* again. I'll still probably be posting around the web, but here's a spot for everything I don't want someone else to own. This blog will probably mix marketing rants, adventures in development from a person who really isn't a developer, photography stuff, local politics, and anything else. It's 2023! Make a website!
