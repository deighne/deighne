Struggling With a Writing Assignment?

<!--more-->

Just go to a niche interest subreddit on the topic and post something inflammatory.

This is how to get angry people (usually men) on the internet to write for you, for free.

Good candidates:
- [r/cameras](https://reddit.com/r/cameras)
- [r/watches](https://reddit.com/r/watches)
- [r/sewing](https://reddit.com/r/sewing)
- [r/bicycles](https://reddit.com/r/bicycles) (but be careful on this one, they're *mean*)
- [r/homeimprovement](https://reddit.com/r/homeimprovement)

Give it a shot?
