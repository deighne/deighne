intro
<!--more-->
outline:

-look, the article is real fuckin good
-the DISCOURSE is revealing
-Danny Sullivan makes the biggest comms mistake you can make
-wait why are people so defensive of Danny Sullivan?
-How Google changed its relationship to SEO to make mainstream SEO (1) almost meaningless, and (2) to get SEOs to defend Google? How the fuck did that happen?
-Threads/Twitter SEO is not real life SEO
-It's time for SEOs to be more cynical again. And also, more Marxist.

include lots of threads/twitter embeds






scraps:

Incredible move on Sullivan's part to write the 5000-word response post to the critical article, where he comes off exactly as described in the critical article. I got hired as an SEO Director at an agency earlier this year, and my first move was training our department on Google Ads and Email so we can stop doing SEO when AI spam takes over our clients' search verticals like it already has in reviews, affiliate marketing, and anything you can drop-ship.



Work in agency so can't share the specifics of client analytics, but I'd point to the explosion in search "hacks" in keyword traffic. The big one for years was appending "reddit" to product recommendation-based searches, less reliable now that SEOs have caught on and that doesn't consistently return reddit discussions, or those discussions are filled with SEO spam, which makes you think. For clients that rely on affiliate marketing via reviews, actual monthly searches have dried up in conjunction with AI-spam sites rising to the top positions with 10,000 word nonsense reviews for any product you can think of. I think it's offset for the public by the number of quick answer searches that people rely on which consistently pull back a smart answer. But are those really search??

this article plays like a comedy central roast of SEO in the best way possible. I'm not even mad about it https://www.theverge.com/features/23931789/seo-search-engine-optimization-experts-google-results


It gets even better: Danny Sullivan got very mad about this article and wrote a response where he comes off exactly as the reporter described https://dannysullivan.com/thoughts-verge-article-seo-6558

"As a person who militantly unsubscribes to any and all marketing emails, I suddenly felt claustrophobic, surrounded by people who annoy the rest of us for a living"




I really love how she brings it home at the end by calling out Danny Sullivan as a corporate shill
