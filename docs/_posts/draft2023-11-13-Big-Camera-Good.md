### 9 Years of Fails

I tried to get into photography a half dozen times between 2012 and 2021. Every time I tried to get started using my phone, got bored and frustrated, and quit.

In 2021 I bought a [2006 DSLR with a kit lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nikon_D40&oldformat=true) at a yard sale and instantly started taking better photos. I've modestly [upgraded bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D3300?oldformat=true) and added to my lens collection since, and feel good enough to "officially" shoot events now. I've got photos up on this site so if you hate them, ignore me?

It never would have happened if I kept following the advice I'd heard dozens of times from art teachers, photographers, and all around the internet: "just use your phone" to learn photography before investing in a camera.

What were y'all smoking?

### You Get Better at Photography by Taking More Pictures. Duh.

I took a photo class in high school that followed a progression like this:

First learn "composition" (you stare at like 10 famous photos in class then try to make a picture like that). Then learn framing, followed by working with lighting. After spending 2/3 of the semester on that, switch the camera out of "auto" and take some corny experimental shots with long shutter speeds, and finally try out adjusting the aperture. Don't even think about taking pictures of people because supposedly that's too hard.

If you google "how to learn photography" you'll get hundreds of variations on this progression.

It's the most painful, least rewarding way to learn photography.

Here's what I did when I got a dedicated camera:

First, I put it in aperture priority and take tons of goofy portrait photos with my pets and family. Sometimes I'd take the same picture rolling the aperture 1/3 a stop each time to see which one I liked best. Then I started paying more attention to light (because more light = crisp picture was obvious when reviewing images), and then learned to shoot in shutter priority to freeze motion more (and try out corny long exposures. That's all that I set out to learn, and got pictures I was proud of in hours. I took lots of pictures.

[literally shot number 1]

I figured out composition and framing over time after accepting, rejecting, cropping, and adjusting images. Hard to do with phone pictures which usually don't make it to a bigger screen!

Not everyone works this way, but artistic endeavors have been easier for me to learn through experimentation than structured learning. Whatever gets me doing the thing the most is probably the best way for me to learn it.

### Design Matters, Actually

Holding a phone to take pictures feels bad. The thing was not made to hold up in front of your face. Duh! If you try to hold a phone in a stable pose akin to a dedicated camera, you're covering up the lenses. 

Dedicated cameras are about the same shape now as they were in the 90s (and not that different from cameras in the 50s). Aside from some misadventures in early mirrorless designs, they're a good size and shape to hold up to your face for a long amount of time. Viewfinders are good!

I don't use the term "real camera" because phones really are cameras, and the design is the key difference. I'd also exclude things like the BlackMagic PCC or GoPros, which can shoot pictures (great ones, even), but are designed for video.

The software design is the bigger thing: default phone camera apps are the ultimate point-and-shoot. You can snap a picture of almost anything and get a result that looks decent and accurate: Lots of detail, lifted shadows, perfect exposure, and a really wide DOF that keeps everything sharp. Behind the scenes, any modern phone camera is taking multiple photos following the shutter, running some amazing processing on it, and spitting out an image that you'd almost never get out of a dedicated camera. It's kind of amazing!

But the camera system was *designed* to work this way, and if you try to take more control, problems show up.

The camera apps don't make settings easy to change. On my iPhone 12, the only real settings I can change are lens (wide angle or standard), flash, and exposure compensation. Aside from that, everything is a "mode": Night Mode, Color Mode, Auto-Crop mode, and so on. Cool, but nothing like adjusting core camera settings like Aperture, Shutter, ISO, and so on.

I can already hear the "$40 android camera app you've never heard of people" yelling at me. Chill out and hold on.

Quickly changing settings while shooting would be hard even if they were easy to access because touchscreens are bad input devices when you're not looking at them. Have you ever tried to play a game with a virtual D-pad and buttons? My vision is only directed 1.5 inches off the thing I'm touching, and it sucks. The Nintendo Switch has less power than a free cricket phone, but it's still better for gaming. The camera apps that let you control those settings can't add buttons and knobs to your phone. 

Sidebar, if you could use a video game controller with an android camera app... maybe would actually be cool?

The other thing is that once you get into alternative camera apps, the processing phones do is discarded or hamstrung. I always get worse pictures from those apps than the phone default. 

Cameras designed to be cameras are good at camera things for lots of reasons besides raw tech specs.

### "Starter Camera" is a Meaningless Term

"Use your phone as a starter camera" as advice in 2023 makes no goddamned sense.

Let's say I own an electric bicycle (I do). One day I get interested in motorcycles, and ask a friend what one I should buy to learn to ride. They tell me I should ride my electric bike as a "starter" motorcycle until I've mastered the basics.

Huh?

I'm sure there's some sickos who refuse to use their phone to take any pictures, but I'm not gonna pander to the perverts. Phone cameras are an incredible utility and **everyone** uses them. For most people under 25, it's the only camera they've ever used.

So a phone is everyone's starter camera, or else it's not close enough to a dedicated camera to count. Either way, if you're asking for camera recommendations in 2023, it's because you want photos that look different than what your phone puts out.

## The Best Camera is Not a Marketing Quip 

"The best camera is the one you have with you"

Nah.

Chase Jarvis either made up or popularized that quote to sell his book of photos (citation) taken on an original iPhone. It's marketing. The dude shot professionally for over a decade, timed the market for when phone photography was an emerging novelty, and got the bag. Now he's just another hustlebro on Twitter. (citation) 

The only good photographers I've seen use phone cameras professionally learned photography on dedicated cameras and still use them. When they take great photos on a phone it feels like a party trick. Good for them?

### Where do Good Pictures Come From, Daddy?

Some people think that photography is some kind of passive foraging exercise: you go about your life, keep your eyes open for great composition (ugh), then whip out the Camera You Always Have With You to caputure the moment.

I don't know a single person who gets great pictures this way.

I've got a 4-year old kid. There's no room in my head for finding compositions while we're out doing anything important, and most of the time whipping out any camera to get a serious picture (including my phone) is a big social faux pas. All my best shots have come from *going out to take pictures with my big camera*. Not to mention that a key skill in event photography is finding shots that make uninteresting moments pop. Unless you normally crawl around on the floor at weddings you'll never get those shots passively.

### What Makes a Photo Look "Good" Right Now

Phone pictures look somewhere between "OK" to "Good" 99% of the time. All that processing turns garbage input on pea-sized sensors into decent output with computer magic.

But there's some hallmarks of a phone picture that maybe weren't noticeable when phone cameras first "got good" (iPhone 4 era, or maybe the first Pixel phone?). Like...
-28mm FOV (the not-quite-a-wide angle)
-Agressively lifted shadows, aggressively toned down highlights
-Wide DOF unless subject is very close to the camera
-Oversaturated skies
-Overboosted contrast on zoomed images

None of those are bad things! But when they're in every post on your instagram timeline they get boring. Taking a stunning picture with a phone is just harder because those small details signal "normal picture."

Portrait mode still can't deal with curly hair. That's racist!

Dedicated cameras, even old ones, look great when used within their limits. Daylit shooting, portraits, and most landscapes look beautiful right out of any dedicated camera from the last 20 years, where a phone picture will just look... OK. Even in low-light, the physics of big sensor + big glass give more interesting pictures that tell a story (albeit a dim one) better than the artifically sharpened + lifted images my phone captures in the dark. This is true even on kit lenses from entry-level models.

Any decent picture that doesn't have the phone-y hallmarks will look more interesting right now. Sorry! I don't make the rules.

### A Late 00s DSLR is the Best Camera for Most Beginners

There's one type of camera that's the best for most people getting into photography, and it's a used, late 2000s, entry-level APS-C DSLR.

Notice I said *most* people. Here's some reasons this would **not** be the best camera.

1. Your budget for 'trying out' a new hobby is greater than ~$1500. If you've got that much money to spend on 'let's see what this activity is like,' then buy a new, mid-tier mirrorless camera and a couple lenses. Congratulations on your financial success.
2. You're a weird android person who *likes* proving your phone can do things dedicated devices are better at. Just admit that you like the pain. Stop reading this post and go back to installing Linux on a Chromebook. I hope you're happy.
3. Your idea of photography is carrying a camera with you at all times to snap pictures of "moments." (Graduations, birthdays, Christmas, etc.). Point-and-shoot cameras were best for this, but phones cameras do a better job of this and are one less device to charge and carry.

With that out of the way, here's why late 2000s DSLRs are the best camera for most people learning photography:

1. **They are cheap**. When it comes to camera bodies, $60 is "good enough", $110 is "very good", and $200 is "not actually that far behind a new mirrorless body." Kit lenses from those generations usually run $30-50, and flagship APS-C primes as a step-up are $100-200. Those prices haven't shifted in 3+ years, and if someone decides that photography isn't for them after trying a starter kit, it's easy to resell equipment and recoup most of the cost.
2. **>=10MP is good enough** for anything on a screen. That's enough to fill a 4K monitor, resolution 3840 X 2160, and still throw away some pixels in the crop. Even 6MP doesn't look *bad* on a big 4K TV, and for print, you can go up to 5 X 7 no problem at that resoltuion. 
3. **The ergonomics** beat most entry-level mirrorless cameras (and any phone). The upside of the longer flange distance in DSLRs is that almost all of them have deep right-hand grips. Most recent mirrorless models have decent grips, but value-for-dollar it's easier to get a comfortable shooting experience on older systems. Single-dial control is fine for most situations save for high-pressure, high-speed shooting on contract.
4. **SD cards are still a standard**. Doesn't matter if you're shooting on a brand-new camera or a 2005 entry-level model; you can pop that card into a reader ($8 on Amazon if you somehow don't have one in your junk drawer) and connect it to a computer, tablet, android, or get a weird lightning SD card reader if all you have is an iPhone, and it'll just work. $12 gets you a 128GB card that will hold thousands of pictures. 

There's other reasons they're a good default suggestion (less novelty features than modern mirrorless cameras, editing 10MP pictures is way easier than 50MP, etc.). Digital is better for learning than film, because waiting on developing + dropping money for film and processing every time you shoot really breaks that feedback loop that helps you improve quickly. And gets expensive.

### Buying Guide

These are some recommendations based on what budget you have to "get started", i.e. purchase a body and a compatible kit lens.

We're just dumb little humans that don't make sense. Spending a moderate sum of money on a new hobby is more fun than trying to use the tools you already have but with *really hard thinking.* 

Hard thinking = no fun. 

Big camera = lots of fun!
