## What photos do you shoot?

I specialize in performance and event photography: musicals, drag, dance, and parties. I also shoot portraits, promotional, headshots, family, pets, indoor/outdoor location photography, boudoir/nude/erotic, and editorial shoots. If you don't see what you want listed, it [doesn't hurt to ask](mailto:mailto:dane@dane.photos).

## What *won't* you shoot?

At the moment, I don't shoot weddings, and nothing with very young children or newborns. If that's what you're after, I'm more than happy to refer you to other very talented photographers who specialize in those shoots. I won't take on jobs that I don't think I will excel at, and all bookings are subject to availability.

## Do you flirt with the limits of discrimination law like most photographers in the south?

Nope! I promise you will not be turned down for a session based on your gender, beliefs (or lack of them), race, appearance, sexual orientation, or any other protected category. I especially love working with LGBTQ+ people and shooting queer-community events (drag shows, musicals, parades, and such.)

## How much does a session cost?

Pricing varies; the quickest way to get an answer is to [email me](mailto:mailto:dane@dane.photos), and I'll either shoot you a quote or reach out with more questions to nail one down.

The biggest factors in pricing are:

* Session/event length
* Number of delivered photos
* Reproduction rights and licensing
* Travel

## Where can you shoot photos? Do you travel?

I'm based in Conway Arkansas. Anything in Little Rock or within a 50-mile drive of Conway is "in-area" with no  travel charge. I can go farther as long as travel expenses are covered; [let me know what you're thinking](mailto:mailto:dane@dane.photos) and I can give you a quote.

## Do you offer retouching and brush-ups?

I offer retouching and brush-ups, but only upon request with specific direction on the changes you want made to your appearance. Pricing for retouching is per-photo and performed after all other editing and selection is finished.

## How do I order prints?

For prints of photos from your session, [email](mailto:mailto:dane@dane.photos) to indicate the prints you want, quantity and size after you receive your gallery.

If you are interested in prints from my portfolio or social media, [email me](mailto:mailto:dane@dane.photos) with the photos you want and I'll respond with print pricing. Some prints are available on [Redbubble](/design/).

## How far in advance do you book?

At least 1 week of notice for small shoots (4 hours or less), and 3-4 weeks for large shoots (full day +) is ideal. However, if you have a last-minute shoot, [please reach out](mailto:mailto:dane@dane.photos) and I'll do my best to make it work.

## Do you have a studio?

I have access to a number of studio locations around Conway for portraits and headshots, and also shoot outdoors and downtown.

## How do I pay you?

I take cash, check, Venmo, CashApp, or card (via Venmo).
